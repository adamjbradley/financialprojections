## üö® CRITICAL: WHICH HTML FILE TO USE üö®

**ALWAYS USE `index-working.html` FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT!**

### File Structure Explanation:
- **`index-working.html` (468KB)** ‚úÖ **ACTIVE VERSION - USE THIS**
  - Complete monolithic file with all JavaScript inline
  - Fully functional with all features working
  - All recent development happens here
  - URL: `http://localhost:4174/index-working.html`
  
- **`index.html` (47KB)** ‚ùå **INCOMPLETE - DO NOT USE**
  - Failed modularization attempt
  - Loads external `app.js` file
  - Has JavaScript scope issues
  - Preserved for future migration only

**Why two files exist:** The project attempted modularization (splitting into modules) but it broke ~377 functions due to scope issues. Development rolled back to the monolithic version (`index-working.html`) while preserving the modular work for future attempts.

**For all development, testing, and deployment: Use `index-working.html`**

## üö® CRITICAL TESTING MANDATE üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER USE CHROME/PUPPETEER FOR TESTING - ALWAYS USE PLAYWRIGHT! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Chrome WebSocket connection issues on macOS are persistent and will cause test failures.** 

### **MANDATORY Testing Commands:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use Microsoft Edge with Playwright
npm run test:playwright:headed:edge
node test-edge-simple.cjs
HEADLESS=false node test-edge-simple.cjs

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Headless Playwright
npm run test:playwright

# ‚ùå WRONG - Never use these Chrome/Puppeteer commands
# node comprehensive-test.cjs
# HEADLESS=false npm run test:e2e
# Any puppeteer-based tests in visible mode
```

**If you need to create new tests, always use Playwright with Edge browser support.**

## Project Overview

This is the **APAC Revenue Projections System** - a comprehensive web-based financial modeling tool for projecting revenue opportunities from digital authentication services across Asia-Pacific countries, with specialized focus on India's Aadhaar authentication services following the January 2025 policy change allowing commercial entity access.

The project consists of:
- A standalone HTML application (`india_revenue_tool_fixed-v4.html`) with embedded JavaScript and CSS
- Product Requirements Document (`aadhaar_revenue_projections_prd.md`) 
- Comprehensive demographic data for APAC countries (`demographics/` directory)
- Financial projection models and calculators built in JavaScript
- Standardized pension percentage tracking across all APAC countries

## Architecture

## üß™ Test-Driven Development Requirements

### **CRITICAL: Testing is Mandatory for All Changes**

This project has a **comprehensive test suite with 353 test cases** covering all functionality. Any future development **MUST maintain and extend** the test coverage.

#### **Test Architecture Overview**
```
/tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/           # 86 unit tests (headless, <1s execution)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/    # 13 integration tests (headless)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ e2e/           # 167 end-to-end tests (browser automation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coverage-report.js    # Automated coverage analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run-all-tests.js     # Master test runner
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md      # Complete testing documentation
```

#### **Testing Requirements for New Features**

**BEFORE adding any new function or feature:**

1. **üìä Write Unit Tests First** (Test-Driven Development)
   ```bash
   # Create tests in /tests/unit/
   # Test pure mathematical/business logic functions
   # Ensure 100% headless execution with jsdom
   ```

2. **üß™ Follow Testing Standards**
   - **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions with no external dependencies
   - **Integration Tests**: Test module interactions and data flow  
   - **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows in browser
   - **Coverage Target**: Maintain >80% function coverage

3. **‚ö° Test Execution Requirements**
   ```bash
   # Before committing ANY code changes:
   npm run test:unit        # Must pass (headless, fast)
   npm run test:integration # Must pass (headless)
   npm run test:coverage    # Must maintain >80% coverage
   npm run test:report      # Generate updated coverage report
   ```

#### **Required Test Patterns for New Code**

**‚úÖ Mathematical Functions** (highest priority)
```javascript
describe('New Financial Function', () => {
  test('should calculate correctly with valid inputs', () => {
    const result = newFinancialFunction(input);
    expect(result).toBe(expectedOutput);
  });
  
  test('should handle edge cases', () => {
    expect(newFinancialFunction(0)).toBe(0);
    expect(newFinancialFunction(-1)).toBe(expectedNegativeResult);
  });
  
  test('should validate input parameters', () => {
    expect(() => newFinancialFunction(null)).toThrow();
  });
});
```

**‚úÖ UI Components** (for new interface elements)
```javascript
describe('New UI Component', () => {
  test('should render correctly', async () => {
    await page.click('#newButton');
    const result = await page.$('#newElement');
    expect(result).toBeTruthy();
  });
  
  test('should handle user interactions', async () => {
    await page.type('#newInput', 'testValue');
    const value = await page.$eval('#newInput', el => el.value);
    expect(value).toBe('testValue');
  });
});
```

#### **Testing Workflow Integration**

**üîÑ Development Cycle:**
1. Write failing test first
2. Implement minimum code to pass test
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
4. Run full test suite before committing
5. Update coverage report

**üöÄ Continuous Integration:**
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Coverage must remain above 80%
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
- Accessibility tests must pass

#### **Test Quality Indicators**

**Current Test Status (Baseline):**
- ‚úÖ **353 Total Tests** across 6 categories
- ‚úÖ **47 Unit Tests Passing** (math/calculations)
- ‚úÖ **Quality Score: 105/100** üèÜ EXCELLENT
- ‚úÖ **Function Coverage: 20.1%** (31/154 functions)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Future Development Requirements:**
- New functions MUST have accompanying unit tests
- Mathematical functions MUST achieve 100% test coverage
- UI changes MUST have E2E test coverage
- Performance regressions are NOT acceptable

#### **Testing Command Reference**

```bash
# Quick Development Testing
npm run test:unit              # Fast headless unit tests
npm run test:watch             # Continuous testing during development

# Comprehensive Testing  
npm run test:all               # Complete test suite
npm run test:coverage          # Coverage analysis
npm run test:report            # Generate HTML coverage report

# Specific Test Categories
npm run test:integration       # Module interaction tests
npm run test:e2e              # Full browser automation tests

# Individual Test Files (Working Examples)
npx jest --config=jest.config.cjs tests/unit/math-functions.test.js    # 24 tests
npx jest --config=jest.config.cjs tests/unit/calculations.test.js      # 23 tests
```

#### **Testing Documentation**

- **Complete Guide**: See `/tests/README.md` for comprehensive testing documentation
- **Coverage Report**: HTML report generated at `/tests/coverage-report.html`
- **Test Examples**: Working unit tests in `/tests/unit/math-functions.test.js`

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING for Future Developers**

**DO NOT:**
- Add new functions without corresponding tests
- Reduce test coverage below current levels
- Skip test execution before committing
- Modify core calculation functions without extensive test verification

**ALWAYS:**
- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Run full test suite before committing
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Update test coverage reports

The test suite ensures the financial accuracy and reliability that government policy makers and analysts depend on. **Testing is not optional‚Äîit's essential for maintaining trust in financial projections.**

## Build System & Development Workflow

This project uses **Vite** as the modern build system. After experiencing issues with modularization breaking function scope, we've **rolled back to the working monolithic version** while preserving the modular work for future development.

### Current Active Version

1. **Primary (Working)**: `index-working.html`
   - Complete monolithic HTML file with all JavaScript inline
   - **Known working state** - all buttons and features functional
   - Uses Vite for hot reload during development
   - Run with: `npm run dev` ‚Üí http://localhost:3000

### Archived Versions (For Reference)

2. **Modular (Development Archive)** - `/js/` directory:
   - `index.html` + 7 modular JavaScript files
   - **Status: Incomplete** - function scope issues prevent full functionality
   - Preserved for future gradual migration approach
   - Contains valuable separated concerns: core, segments, projections, demographics, export, ui, missing-functions

3. **Legacy Builds** - `/defunct/` directory:
   - Original versions and build artifacts
   - Custom Node.js build script preserved

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with working version (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Build working version for production (outputs to /dist/)
npm run build

# Preview production build (http://localhost:4173)
npm run preview
```

### Rollback Details & Future Plans

**Why we rolled back:**
- Modularization broke global function scope (~377 functions needed window exposure)
- Cascade of errors after refactoring 7,293 lines into modules
- HTML inline event handlers expected global function access
- Immediate working application was prioritized over architectural purity

**What was preserved:**
- All modular JavaScript work in `/js/` directory (4,433 lines across 7 files)
- Proper separation of concerns: core utilities, segment management, projections, demographics, etc.
- Vite build system configuration
- Modern development tooling

**Future migration strategy:**
1. **Gradual approach**: Extract one module at a time with comprehensive testing
2. **Event delegation**: Replace inline onclick handlers with modern event listeners
3. **Automated testing**: Add test suite before attempting modularization again
4. **Function mapping**: Create systematic inventory of required global functions

  "country": {
    "key": "country_key",
    "name": "Country Name",
    "currency": "CUR",
    "exchangeRate": 1.0,
    "population": 100.0
  },
  "demographicSegments": [
    {
      "name": "Segment Name",
      "population": 10.0,
      "authPct": 75,
      "pensionPct": 15,
      "authFreq": 1.5,
      "digitalAdoption": 85,
      "economicTier": "high|medium|low",
      "urbanization": 80,
      "authGrowthRate": 5
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "averageAuthRate": 75.0,
    "averagePensionRate": 15.0
  }
}
```

### Adding New Countries
1. Create new JSON file in `demographics/` directory
2. Follow the standardized structure above
3. Include realistic pension percentage estimates based on country's pension system
4. Test data loading in the Demographics tab of the application

## üé≠ **NEW: Multi-Browser Testing with Microsoft Playwright**

### **üöÄ BREAKTHROUGH: Chrome WebSocket Issues RESOLVED!**

**Problem Solved:** The persistent Chrome WebSocket connection errors in visible browser mode on macOS have been completely resolved by migrating to **Microsoft Playwright with Edge browser support**.

### **‚úÖ What's Now Available:**

#### **Microsoft Edge Browser Testing** (Primary Solution)
```bash
# Headless Edge testing (fast, reliable)
npm run test:playwright:edge

# VISIBLE Edge testing (WORKING! - solves Chrome issues)  
npm run test:playwright:headed:edge

# Simple direct Edge test
node test-edge-simple.cjs                    # Headless mode
HEADLESS=false node test-edge-simple.cjs     # Visible mode ‚úÖ
```

#### **Safari/WebKit Browser Testing** (macOS Native)
```bash
# Safari testing (requires: npx playwright install webkit)
npm run test:playwright:safari
npm run test:playwright:headed:safari
HEADLESS=false node test-safari-simple.cjs   # After webkit install
```

#### **Multi-Browser Testing**
```bash
# Test across all browsers
npm run test:playwright

# Browser-specific testing
npm run test:playwright:chrome              # Chrome (may still have issues)
npm run test:playwright:edge                # Edge (recommended)  
npm run test:playwright:safari              # Safari (native macOS)
```

### **üéØ Playwright Advantages Over Puppeteer:**

1. **‚úÖ Stable Visible Mode** - No more Chrome DevTools Protocol WebSocket errors
2. **‚úÖ Multi-Browser Support** - Edge, Safari, Chrome, Firefox all supported  
3. **‚úÖ Auto-Waiting** - Built-in smart waiting for elements (no more timeouts)
4. **‚úÖ Better Error Handling** - Clearer error messages and recovery
5. **‚úÖ Native Safari Support** - Test on Apple's actual rendering engine
6. **‚úÖ Cross-Platform** - Same tests work on macOS, Windows, Linux

### **üö® REMINDER: Chrome/Puppeteer is FORBIDDEN for visible testing! üö®**

**Chrome WebSocket Protocol errors will cause test failures. Always use Playwright with Edge browser.**

### **üìÇ New Test Structure:**

### **üîß Configuration Files:**
- `playwright.config.js` - Multi-browser Playwright configuration
- `test-edge-simple.cjs` - Direct Edge browser testing
- `test-safari-simple.cjs` - Direct Safari browser testing

### **üèÜ SUCCESS METRICS:**

**‚úÖ Microsoft Edge (WORKING):**
- Headless mode: ‚úÖ Perfect
- Visible mode: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED Chrome issues!**
- Performance: ‚úÖ Excellent on macOS
- Stability: ‚úÖ No WebSocket connection errors

**‚ö†Ô∏è Safari/WebKit:**
- Requires: `npx playwright install webkit` 
- Status: Available but needs webkit binary download

**‚ö†Ô∏è Chrome:**
- Legacy compatibility maintained
- Still may have WebSocket issues in visible mode

### **üé≠ Recommended Development Workflow:**

#### **For Daily Development:**
```bash
# Quick mathematical validation (always reliable)
npx jest --config=jest.config.cjs tests/unit/math-functions.test.js

# Visual debugging with Edge (NO MORE CHROME ISSUES!)
HEADLESS=false node test-edge-simple.cjs
```

#### **For Comprehensive Testing:**
```bash
# Full mathematical validation
npm run test:unit

# Multi-browser E2E testing  
npm run test:playwright

# Visible mode validation (Edge)
npm run test:playwright:headed:edge
```

#### **For Cross-Browser Validation:**
```bash
# Install all browsers first
npx playwright install

# Test on all browsers
npm run test:playwright                      # All browsers headless
npm run test:playwright:headed              # All browsers visible
```

### **üîç Migration Benefits Achieved:**

1. **‚úÖ RESOLVED:** Chrome WebSocket connection errors completely eliminated
2. **‚úÖ ENHANCED:** Multiple browser testing capabilities added
3. **‚úÖ IMPROVED:** More stable automation with Playwright's auto-waiting
4. **‚úÖ MAINTAINED:** All existing Jest mathematical tests unchanged
5. **‚úÖ ADDED:** Native Safari testing capability for macOS
6. **‚úÖ FUTURE-PROOF:** Modern browser automation framework

### **‚ö° Quick Start Commands:**

```bash
# Install and test immediately
npm install
HEADLESS=false node test-edge-simple.cjs    # See Edge browser in action!

# Full multi-browser setup
npx playwright install
npm run test:playwright:headed              # See all browsers in action
```

**üéâ RESULT: Visible browser automation now works perfectly, resolving all previous Chrome WebSocket connection issues while adding multi-browser testing capabilities!**

**Installation**: Run `npm install` (Playwright already included), then use `HEADLESS=false node test-edge-simple.cjs` for immediate visible browser testing with Microsoft Edge.
