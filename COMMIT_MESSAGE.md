# Commit Message for Recent Changes

## Summary
feat: Add model confirmation, segment editing, exchange rate updates, auto-projections, and watch mode

## Detailed Changes

### üîí Model Loading Confirmation
- Add confirmation prompt when loading saved models from Saved Models tab
- Display model details (segments, country, version, last updated) before loading
- Prevent accidental model overwrites
- User must explicitly confirm before replacing current work
- **Files**: `index-working.html` (loadModelWithConfirmation function)

### ‚úèÔ∏è Segment Management During Model Editing
- Add comprehensive segment management to model edit dialog
- Enable adding new segments while editing models
- Enable removing segments with confirmation
- Enable inline editing of segment properties (name, price, volume, growth, category)
- Real-time property updates with `updateSegmentProperty` function
- Display segment count dynamically
- **Files**: `index-working.html` (populateModelEditSegments, addSegmentToModel, removeSegmentFromModel functions)

### üìä Analysis Tab Auto-Refresh
- Automatically refresh analysis tab data after projection calculations
- Update revenue opportunities with latest projection totals
- Update growth potential metrics from segment data
- Refresh demographic insights with current country data
- **Files**: `index-working.html` (refreshAnalysisData, updateRevenueOpportunity, updateGrowthPotentialMetrics functions)

### üí± Exchange Rate Improvements
- Fix exchange rate not updating when switching countries
- Add fallback mechanism using demographic data when external config unavailable
- Add default exchange rates for all APAC countries
- Update exchange rate on initial page load
- Update exchange rate after currency system initialization
- Update exchange rate after demographic data loads
- Add visual feedback with blue field highlight on rate change
- Add toast notifications showing old ‚Üí new rate with percentage change
- Support silent mode for initial loads (no toast spam)
- Show directional arrows and color-coded percentage changes
- Enhanced `showSuccessMessage` to support HTML content and custom duration
- **Files**: `index-working.html` (changeCountry, updateSetupPageExchangeRate, initializeCurrencySystem, showSuccessMessage functions)

### üöÄ Auto-Run Projections
- Automatically calculate projections when switching to Projections tab
- Detect if projections haven't been run yet
- Detect if segments have changed since last projection
- Auto-recalculate when segment count changes
- Show helpful message if no segments exist
- Track segment count for change detection (`window.lastProjectionSegmentCount`)
- Display toast notifications during auto-calculation
- Prevent double tab switching during auto-run
- **Files**: `index-working.html` (switchTab function enhancement, calculateProjections tracking)

### üîÑ Auto-Build Watch Mode
- Add `npm run watch` for automatic rebuilding to dist/ on file changes
- Add `npm run watch:full` for custom file pattern watching
- Add `npm run dev:auto` to build once then watch
- Add `npm run dev:preview` to watch and preview together
- Install chokidar-cli for file watching capabilities
- Install concurrently for running parallel commands
- **Files**: `package.json`, `DEVELOPMENT-MODES.md`

### üìö Documentation Updates
- Update CLAUDE.md with critical file structure explanation
- Add warnings about index.html being incomplete
- Create PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md with comprehensive file documentation
- Add header comments to both HTML files explaining their purpose
- Create DEVELOPMENT-MODES.md explaining all development workflows
- Document which HTML file to use (index-working.html)
- Explain the failed modularization attempt
- **Files**: `CLAUDE.md`, `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT-MODES.md`, `index.html`, `index-working.html` (header comments)

## Technical Details

### New Functions Added:
- `loadModelWithConfirmation(modelId)` - Model loading with user confirmation
- `populateModelEditSegments(model)` - Display segments in edit dialog
- `addSegmentToModel()` - Add new segment to model being edited
- `removeSegmentFromModel(segmentId)` - Remove segment with confirmation
- `updateSegmentProperty(segmentId, property, value)` - Real-time segment editing
- `refreshAnalysisData()` - Refresh analysis tab after projections
- `updateRevenueOpportunity()` - Update revenue metrics
- `updateGrowthPotentialMetrics()` - Update growth metrics

### Modified Functions:
- `changeCountry()` - Enhanced with multiple fallback mechanisms for exchange rates
- `updateSetupPageExchangeRate()` - Now shows toast notifications and highlights field
- `showSuccessMessage()` - Supports HTML content and custom duration
- `initializeCurrencySystem()` - Updates exchange rate on startup
- `switchTab()` - Auto-runs projections when switching to Projections tab
- `calculateProjections()` - Tracks segment count for change detection
- `refreshCurrencyRates()` - Updates Setup page exchange rate with notification

### New Global Variables:
- `window.lastProjectionSegmentCount` - Tracks segment count for change detection

### Dependencies Added:
- `chokidar-cli` (v3.0.0) - File watching for auto-build
- `concurrently` (v9.1.2) - Parallel command execution

## Files Changed

### Modified:
- `index-working.html` - Main application file (all feature implementations)
- `package.json` - Added watch mode scripts and dependencies

### Created:
- `COMMIT_MESSAGE.md` - This file
- `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md` - File structure documentation
- `DEVELOPMENT-MODES.md` - Development workflow documentation

### Enhanced:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added critical file usage information
- `index.html` - Added warning header comment
- `index-working.html` - Added active file header comment

## Testing Performed
- ‚úÖ Model loading confirmation dialog displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Segment management in model editing works (add/remove/edit)
- ‚úÖ Analysis tab refreshes after projection calculations
- ‚úÖ Exchange rates update correctly when switching countries
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications show exchange rate changes
- ‚úÖ Auto-projection runs when switching to Projections tab
- ‚úÖ Segment change detection triggers recalculation
- ‚úÖ Watch mode automatically rebuilds to dist/
- ‚úÖ Application builds successfully with all changes

## Breaking Changes
None. All changes are additive and backward compatible.

## Migration Notes
- No migration needed for existing saved models
- Exchange rates will auto-update on first country switch
- Projections will auto-calculate on first Projections tab visit

## Related Issues
- Fixes: Exchange rate incorrectly showing default value on startup
- Fixes: Model loading without confirmation could overwrite work
- Fixes: No way to edit segments within model edit dialog
- Fixes: Analysis tab showing stale data after projections
- Fixes: Users had to manually click "Calculate" every time
- Fixes: No auto-build functionality for dist/ folder
